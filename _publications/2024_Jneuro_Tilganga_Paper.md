This paper describes a bridge program designed to prepare trainees from countries with limited science research, like Nepal, for doctoral studies abroad. Trainees will be co-mentored by scientists in their home and host countries, participate in research projects, and mentor future cohorts. The program aims to develop research capacity and foster a collaborative team of scientists who will eventually lead research in their home countries. We presented our work at Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology highlight the importance of addressing social needs through research and emphasize diversity, participation, and equity in science infrastructure development. The long-term goal is to establish a sustainable, locally-driven research culture.
